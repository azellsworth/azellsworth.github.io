##Debugging short code

Have you ever been writing a short piece of javascript and wished you could debug it easily? If you enjoy using the chrome developer tools (which have a great debugger), they have a special feature called snippits to help you with just that. 

##Snippits

Snippits allow you to write or paste in code, run it, and set up line breaks and watch variables in order to fully test your code.

You can access snippits through the chrome developer tools, under sources. Just right click to open a new snippit, and input your code. You can then run your code by right clicking on your snippit and selecting run. 

##Video Demo

Hereâ€™s a video example to show you how to get started:
